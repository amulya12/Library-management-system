# Library-management-system
Library management system is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of library.
Our Library Management System has dual portal one for student and one for librarian which is generally not seen in other Library Management Systems as they are only equipped with librarian portal where a librarian can generally add books, delete books, search book, Modify book details and issue books. 
Despite these we also have student login with the help of which students can suggest books which should be added into library. 
They can provide ratings for existing books.  
It also provides some general update of library like books added recently and keeps even the librarian updated too as he can see the books suggested by the students which makes it more attractive. 
Admin account also has an option to Add new student id as the current student login lands to Student main menu only if the student is existing member of class.
Overall this project of ours is being enveloped to help the students as well as staff of library to maintain the library in the best way possible and reduce the human efforts.
